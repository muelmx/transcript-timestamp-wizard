# Transcript Timestamp Wizard
A simple tool to convert transcripts generated by Adobe® Premiere Pro® to a Atlas.ti and MAXQDA compatible format in a GDPR-compliant way.

Conversion is performed locally in the browser. The app does not contain any tracking or backend interaction whatsoever.

## Development
The app is loosely based on the onion architecture, splitting in infrastructure, domain and use case implementation.

- infra: contains code related to dom interaction and technology specific interface implementations.
- domain: contains domain logic for file types and transformer.
- use case: contains use case logic.

### Setup

- Install Node LTS
- Run `npm i`
- Build using `npm run build` or keep it building on change using `npm run watch`
- Execute tests using `npm run test`

### Build Process

The app uses _Webpack_ for transpiling and packaging into a single html file. Code and styles are included inline to allow downloading and running a single html file locally.

### Hosting

The app is hosted on Google Firebase. The provided GitHub actions are deploying to temporary environments for merge requests and the production environment on main branch.
